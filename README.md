# Arkanoid-like-Game
This is the first coursework of COMP222 at the University of Liverpool. The objective of this assignment is to implement a game inspired by the classic arcade game Arkanoid using Unity 3D game engine.

## Game Description
The game is played on a rectangular field with solid top andsides and an open bottom.  In the middle of the field, game objects are positioned.  A playercontrols  a  moving  paddle  at  the  bottom  of  the  field,  which  prevents  the  game  ball  fromfalling from the field.  The game ball bounces off the paddle, the boundaries and the gameobjects on the field.  When the game ball strikes a game object on the field, the object isremoved.  When all objects are gone, the player wins the round.

## Coursework Task
In the classic game, the game objects are rectangular.  In this assignment, we will useballs as obstacles.
This assignment requires students to implement a simple 3D game using the Unity 3D game engine.

## Final Product Presentatiom
### Extra Features
1. Threeextra  scenes(like  a  prologue  interface)  will  appear  before  the  three  game  levelsseparately, which need player to press”start” buttonto transfer to those real game scenes.
1. Acountdownwas set at the beginning of each level, to give player some preparation timebefore entering the intensive game interaction.
1. There aredifferent backgroundscooperating withtexturesfor different themes colors ineach game level.
